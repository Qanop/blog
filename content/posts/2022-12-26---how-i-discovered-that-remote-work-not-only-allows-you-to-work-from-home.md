It's been a while since I last posted an update on the blog, but believe me, a lot has changed. For a few months, I've been trying to sort out things related to a trip to rather far country. The reason? To visit my friend who decided to move from the Netherlands to other place for a while. The journey... Well, what was originally planned as a quick test of remote work as a 3-week vacation + 3 weeks of remote work, to then return to my home, fell to pieces and turned into quite a long stay for me in the very center foreign country (when all my plans changed to stay here for only 2 months, then 3 months until the Christmas, to maybe 6 months until the end of winter - and as today, to not have plan to return that quickly to my country and thinking how to stay here longer).

During this adventure, I met many interesting people. I also have to say that people in this country are very friendly. A longer stay here was also made possible by a closer encounter with culture, much closer to my heart and hobby. Also, my dear partner who makes my life enjoyable. That also could be influenced by just changing rather coldish environments to warmer ones.

I was also able to work remotely, despite the initial shift in working hours. I reduce this time by shifting my work hours to different part of the day, which corresponds to classic 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. office hours in my country. This is a good alternative for me because in the later hours of the day I can concentrate better and perform assigned tasks more quickly. I hope that in the future I will be able to arrange fully asynchronous work - but time will show. At the moment, I am very happy with the current result.
