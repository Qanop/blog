It’s durable (hole in the wall confirm it) ThinkPad T450s. So… It’s components are not great and not terrible - i5-5300U with Intel HD 5500. And that added me additional problems to the list. As you can see, Vulcan have only <a href=\"https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/new-intel-vulkan-beta-1540204404-graphics-driver-for-windows-78110-1540.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">partial support</a> for older CPU Intel generations, so it could cause problems if you are not aware off different installation of dxvk library. For basic installation of dxvk on Debian with only Intel graphics you can follow <a href=\"https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mesa driver guide</a> that is required also <a href=\"https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">by the Lutris</a>.</p>\n<p>When installing Lutris, be aware, that you need ALL required components of Wine! Even when Lustris manage to download its own Wine libs, it’s still using some system libraries. That’s why you should follow fully <a href=\"https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wine Dependencies guide</a>. </p>\n<p>As I mention before, I had problem with Debian installation of Wine on my laptop. Main problem was caused by wrongly committed version to debian repository - and it’s common problem for past few months in Wine community…</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token function\">sudo</span> <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --install-recommends winehq-staging\n\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n winehq-staging <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">:</span> Depends: wine-staging <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6.17</span>~focal-1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.</code></pre></div>\n<p>To ‘fix’ it, just enter to download site of Wine, and download and install <a href=\"https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/debian/dists/buster/main/binary-amd64/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">winehq-staging .deb</a> package manually. Causing problem could occur by missing libfaudio0 library, which could not be installed with package manager… But thanks to <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/1145473/how-do-i-install-libfaudio0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this post</a> on Ubuntu forum, I found <a href=\"https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10/amd64/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">open repository</a> containing right library package.</p>\n<p>After this, I finally could play my games running on DirectX 9 (But translated in air by Vulcan, which give additional 50% boost). So yea, game was pretty much playable with stable 20 fps (and with later expansion 17fps), on the lowest settings - but I didn’t expect much, and I was glad that it could ever work on this device. But I have one conclusion - If you want a Linux distro for gaming proposes, you should install Ubuntu or Pop!OS… It’s easier to set up.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/installing-lutris-on-debian-from-a-to-z","tagSlugs":["/tag/technology/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-10-16T08:32:54.000Z","description":"After Nth attempt I finally managed to install fully working Lustris on Debian.
