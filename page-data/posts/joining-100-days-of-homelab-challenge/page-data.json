Turns out I also hit on the perfect opportunity to develop my current work with new event. <a href=\"https://100daysofhomelab.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">#100DaysOfHomeLab</a>, an event created by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwDVW_ifkBU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Techno Tim</a> as a 100k celebration video, encourages you to spend 1 hour a day for 100 days developing your home environment. For the foreseeable future we may see a collaboration of the largest accounts dedicated to building a HomeLab. Each of the creators with a different approach to technology and the tools used - which can each be adapted to our needs. Along with this event, I have likewise planned new work that will expand my current setup.</p>\n<p>Planned activities for near future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding openHAB</li>\n<li>automated backups</li>\n<li>converting HomeLab to k3s</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Weâ€™ll see how many of these things I can get done. I will also try to give updates from week to week on the development of the project. I think this is a great option for everyone to join in creating their own HomeLab solution. To the next update!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/joining-100-days-of-homelab-challenge","tagSlugs":["/tag/100-days-of-home-lab/","/tag/technology/","/tag/ops-dev-ops/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-06-12T22:47:45.000Z","description":"At the beginning of the month, following the words of my friend, I started looking into putting up a HomeLab server.
