If you need to collect and re-check it yourself, you have to go through customs and immigration again, as conveyer belt and international departure zone are on a different levels on airport - requiring you to leave international flight zone.</p>\n<p>In summary, flying to Japan via a Vietnam airport can be a convenient and cheap option for travelers.
