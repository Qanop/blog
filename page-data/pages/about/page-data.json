It is an interesting art that lead you to work and match up with another person. This way can open door to many styles of photography. Everyone works differently and different styles suit them. Therefore, each subsequent photo session gives me pleasure and allows me to implement more and more new ideas.<br>\nI share my works most often by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/atryniphotography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">posting on the Flickr channel</a>. Sometimes photos are also posted on social networks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-am-a-software-developer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-am-a-software-developer\" aria-label=\"i am a software developer permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I am a software developer.</h2>\n<p>The current commercial experience that I have is based on 3 programming languages. Each of the languages used in the project is used for different purposes, but their placement gives the best possible results for the given task. I love learning about new technologies and tools. Thanks to them, we can set ourselves higher and higher design requirements and push the development of the project without fear of encountering a technological bottleneck. Of course, during the project breaks between programming tasks, I also deal with Ops and DevOps topics. </p>\n<p>Recently, I have been spending my time learning project-related procedures and tools as well as allowing for better server scalability. Time will show what you can get. :)</p>\n<p>I would like to post my thoughts and actions on my website. This is a good place for me to take notes on a topic, find a solution to a topic, and maybe come back to it after a while. It is also an ideal situation to be able to share them with others. Well, maybe someone will come in handy someday when they have a problem. Either way, sharing what you’ve learned is the key to faster development. So… TEST> COMMIT> PUSH> RELEASE</p>\n<p>In addition, apart from industry experience, I also learn and develop in other technologies.
