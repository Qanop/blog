I’m talking about <a href=\"https://github.com/GramAddict/bot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GramAddict</a>, which uses the debug of the android phone and performs operations directly on device. Using the phone connected to the computer that was executing the script, I admit that it helped me to focus more on my work and not get distracted by the phone. </p>\n<p>During setup, I sometimes had the problem of the cable disconnecting and losing my data transfer settings (probably broken connectors in phone USB port). This was quite annoying, especially when the device charging itself was left unchanged when the connection was interrupted. The best solution I came up with was to simply connect to the debugger via Wi-Fi, where the phone can now lie in any corner of the house and scroll the feed in peace. </p>\n<p>Having tested this software for over the month, I would recommend it. GramAddict has lots of configuration options, had no problem with new Instagram media formats and has additional modules for reporting and saving previous operations.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/automate-instagram-feed-with-gramaddict","tagSlugs":["/tag/technology/","/tag/ops-dev-ops/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-06-17T17:27:13.000Z","description":"Sometimes I don't have time to browse Instagram, and as you know - spent time on your account will definitely help your SEO and getting your online activity noticed by others.
