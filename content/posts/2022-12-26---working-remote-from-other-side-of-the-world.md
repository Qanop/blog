It's been a while since I last posted an update on the blog, but believe me, a lot has changed. For a few months, I've been trying to sort out things related to a trip to the other side of the world. The reason? To visit my friend who decided to move to Thailand for a while. The journey... Well, what was originally planned as a quick test of remote work as a 3-week vacation + 3 weeks of remote work, to then return to Europe, fell to pieces and turned into a permanent stay for me in the very center of Bangkok (with plans changing to stay for 2 months, 3 months until the holidays, maybe 6 months until the end of winter, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL BE THE LAST CHANGE OF PLANS).

During this adventure, I met many interesting people. I also have to say that people in this country are very friendly. A longer stay here was also made possible by a closer encounter with culture, much closer to my heart and hobby. Also, my dear partner who makes my life enjoyable.

I was also able to work remotely, despite the initial shift in working hours by 5 hours. Currently, during the winter, the time difference between the office and me is 6 hours. I reduce this time by shifting my work hours to the evening, working from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., which corresponds to 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. in Poland. This is a good alternative for me because in the later hours of the day I can concentrate better and perform assigned tasks more quickly. I hope that in the future I will be able to arrange fully asynchronous work - but time will show. At the moment, I am very happy with the current result.
