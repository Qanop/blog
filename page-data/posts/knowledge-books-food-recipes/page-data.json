I had several approaches to this dish and I must admit, there are no bad results here - each variant tastes special. Don himself is really well described on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TiCcI3s6ZM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CHEFPK channel</a>.</p>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>beef meat</li>\n<li>1 onion / 200g meat</li>\n<li>rice</li>\n<li>peper &#x26; salt</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Extras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>maple syrup + miso for marinate</li>\n<li>Japanese prunes or other bitter dried fruit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a first step, we prepare the onion by cutting it into cubes. Put the first layer on the plate, then put the meat in it and cover it with the second layer of onion. The beef should then wait in this state for half to two hours. While waiting for the taste to soak and soften the meat, we can prepare the rice. After that time, remove the onion from meat and sauté it in a pan. Burn the meat in a frying pan and prepare it for the frying you want. The last step is to put rice, meat and a hill of onion into the bowl and pour the resulting sauce from the pan over it.</p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The meat can be prepared sous vide by enclosing it in a bag together with the marinade</li>\n<li>An addition to rice can be rice sauce or dried Japanese cherry particles</li>\n<li>While in a rice cooker, you can add additional ingredients to make rice soak in additional flavors</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"massaman-curry\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#massaman-curry\" aria-label=\"massaman curry permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Massaman curry</h2>\n<p>It’s worth experimenting in the kitchen. Thanks to them, we have rediscovery tasteful combinations of flavors. Last time I was able to put together a good combination for the curry</p>\n<p>Ingredients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chicken/pork/beef meat</li>\n<li>1 onion / 200g meat</li>\n<li>massaman curry paste</li>\n<li>rice</li>\n<li>soy sauce &#x26; teriyaki sauce</li>\n<li>salt, garlic, citric acid, ground paprika, ginger</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Extras:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>yakisoba sauce</li>\n<li>dry wine </li>\n<li>rice vinegar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Preparations should start with the onion glazing and rice cooking simultaneously. During frying, it is worth adding spices such as garlic, citric acid, and a pinch of salt to it. When the onion is almost ready, add the meat that will use the current sauce. To increase the flavor variation of the meat, you can add additional spices such as ground paprika or ginger. The next step is to pour coconut milk over the pan content and add the curry paste. Add soy and teriyaki sauce, rice vinegar, and reduce the sauce. Halfway through the process, add extra dry wine to enhance the umami of the curry. The finished product should be served in a bowl along with rice, cherry tomatoes, and chives. The variation in the preparation of the dish may simply change.</p>\n<p>Modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a flavor variation to the cooking rice</p>\n<ul>\n<li>yakisoba sauce and rice vinegar</li>\n<li>soy sauce and a mixture of ground paprika</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>curry works very well with the 5-taste variant (not 5-flavor variant), so add a different mix of spices</li>\n<li>rice to increase its taste, you can fry it slowly with an egg in a pan (it’s worth adding spices to close them in the middle of the rice coated with egg protein)</li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/knowledge-books-food-recipes","tagSlugs":["/tag/cooking/","/tag/knowledge-books/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-11-15T19:08:58.000Z","description":"Free time is a really good thing.
