In few weeks I plan to go take a flight to Japan. But to spare some money, I plan to use multiple connections over direct flights - what it also comes with some disadvantages.

Flying from my initial airport in Bangkok (Thailand), I plan to go to Japan via Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam) airport. However, there is a catch in booking system. If you have booked two separate tickets for your journey and need to transit at the Vietnam airport as me, you need to fulfill additional visa requirements.

Firstly, it is crucial to check the [visa requirements for Vietnam](https://visaguide.world/asia/vietnam-visa/do-i-need-a-visa-for-vietnam/) before you book your tickets. Depending on your nationality and the length of your stay in Vietnam, you may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain a visa on arrival. It is important to note that if you are transiting through Vietnam without leaving the airport, you may still require a Vietnam Transit Visa ($25 fee). 

As official articles say, if you are transiting in an airport in Vietnam and omitting all Vietnam Transit Visa acquire problems, you need to fulfill this steps:
- You have a ticket for a connecting flight within the next 24 hours
- You will not leave the airport international transit area
- You have the necessary documents for your final destination (passport, visa, etc)
On the other hand, if your connecting flight is further than 24 hours away, or you would like to enter Vietnam while you wait, you will have to get a visa. **This rule excludes all booked flights booked as separate tickets!**

So, when booking separate tickets for your journey, it is important to leave sufficient time for transit between flights. If your first flight is delayed or canceled (happen a lot in SEASIA flights), you may miss your connecting flight by spending crucial time on going through security and immigration checks.

Also, important note about luggage: If you have it checked, it is important to confirm with the airline whether your bags will be automatically transferred to your connecting flight or whether you will need to collect them and re-check them - it's possible that airlines have inner agreement to transfer your luggage between their flights like Vietnam Airlines <-> Etihad. If you need to collect and re-check it yourself, you have to go through customs and immigration again, as conveyer belt and international departure zone are on a different levels on airport - requiring you to leave international flight zone.

In summary, flying to Japan via a Vietnam airport can be a convenient and cheap option for travelers. However, if you have booked tickets for your journey, it is important to if you need to apply for Vietnam Transit Visa, leave sufficient time for transit, and be prepared for security and immigration checks. By following these tips, you can ensure a smooth travel experience and enjoy your trip.
