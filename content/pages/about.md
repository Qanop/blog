## Blogging as a Hobby
_I write this blog in my free time as a way to share news, knowledge, and practical solutions with the wider community. Many of the topics I cover address rare or challenging problems that I personally struggled to solve—by documenting these solutions, I hope to make them easier to find and help others avoid repeating the same search cycle._

> Sharing what I learn is both a passion and a way to give back to the tech community.

## Senior DevOps Engineer
As a Senior DevOps Engineer, I specialize in architecting and scaling cloud-native solutions for enterprise and startup clients. My expertise spans Azure and AWS, with a proven track record of leading DevOps transformations, optimizing infrastructure, and enabling high-performing teams.

I have successfully managed Azure infrastructure for **40+ microservices** supporting request flow **over 10,000 users**, driving **migrations from Bicep to Terraform** and orchestrating the **transition to Kubernetes** (AKS), resulting in a **35% boost in costs and scalability**. My **hybrid cloud/on-premises** designs leverage Terraform and Helm for flexible, secure deployments across diverse environments.

I am passionate about automation and efficiency—reducing infrastructure setup time by 30% for multiple clients through robust scripting and CI/CD pipelines. 

I have mentored DevOps teams, authored comprehensive runbooks and tutorials, and championed best practices in security, observability (ELK), and documentation.

Key skills:  
- OnPrem: Proxmox, Linux
- Cloud: Azure (AKS, ApiM, App Services, Databases, Key Vault, FrontDoor), AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, EKS)
- IaC: Terraform, Bicep
- Orchestration: Kubernetes, Helm, Docker
- CI/CD: Azure DevOps, GitLab, AWS CodePipeline
- Monitoring: ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana
- Version Control: Git, GitHub, GitLab, pre-commit hooks
- Automation: Python, Bash, Ansible, Semaphore
- Mentorship, Documentation, Security Best Practices, Runbooks

I thrive in dynamic environments, bridging development and operations, and empowering teams to deliver reliable, scalable, and secure solutions.

## Community & Meetups

I actively participate in IT Tech meetups to stay updated on the latest advancements, tools, and solutions used by other professionals and companies. Engaging with the tech community allows me to exchange knowledge, share discoveries, and build a strong network across multiple technology sectors. 

This collaborative approach helps me bring fresh perspectives and proven solutions to my team, ensuring we always have access to the best practices and a diverse set of skills.

To stay up-to-date, I connect my feed to platforms like **dev.to**, **Medium**, and update feeds of the tools and technologies I use. This helps me track the latest news, releases, and best practices for the solutions I maintain, ensuring my knowledge and content remain current.

## Homelab Enthusiast
I am passionate about building and experimenting with homelab environments. My home rack features a **3-node cluster** running a **20TB ZFS NAS**, architected for **3-2-1 redundancy** and offsite backups to ensure data durability.

I regularly explore new tools, automate infrastructure, and design high-availability solutions for private clusters. My setup serves as a sandbox for testing Kubernetes deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and advanced networking—enabling me to prototype, break, and improve systems in a safe, hands-on environment.

Beyond infrastructure, I create home automations and native off-cloud tools to streamline daily routines and enhance privacy. I monitor my solutions with self-hosted observability stacks, ensuring reliability and rapid troubleshooting. I leverage n8n for workflow automation and integrate local AI tools to improve system integrations and experiment with intelligent automation.

This continuous experimentation sharpens my skills and keeps me at the forefront of DevOps and automation innovation.
