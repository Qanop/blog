This time the search is directed a bit differently than the access and HTTP servers. The first thing we need to pay attention to is where the service is run, and then what is the suggested rental price of the resources. From large suppliers, we may be interested in well-known service providers such as OVH, AWS, Azure or Google. They can often have strong server rental deals or special free-tier offers. However, be careful whether the server will not be refunded after the end of the promotional period.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 960px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/47311/server-3.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 42.91666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/8ac56/server-3.webp 240w,\n/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/d3be9/server-3.webp 480w,\n/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/e46b2/server-3.webp 960w,\n/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/260c2/server-3.webp 1080w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/09b79/server-3.jpg 240w,\n/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/7cc5e/server-3.jpg 480w,\n/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/6a068/server-3.jpg 960w,\n/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/47311/server-3.jpg 1080w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/0c1a52aeacc5dcaf5e0da19a48c4350d/6a068/server-3.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Solutions for own media center\"\n          title=\"Solutions for own media center\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In paid offers from service providers you can find very cheap servers listed below</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vultr: Worldwide locations, IPv6 support, starting at $3.50/month</li>\n<li>Hetzner: Germany, IPv6, 20 TB of traffic, starting at €3/month</li>\n<li>Digital Ocean: Worldwide locations, IPv6 support, starting at $5/month</li>\n<li>PulseHeberg: France, unlimited bandwidth, starting at €3/month</li>\n<li>OVH: Worldwide locations, IPv6 support, starting at $3.50/month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently, the most attractive offer, in my opinion, can boast of google cloud, which offers a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">full free-tier</a> for a machine located in Oregon, Iowa or South Carolina.</p>\n<h2 id=\"free-tier-in-google-cloud-platform\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#free-tier-in-google-cloud-platform\" aria-label=\"free tier in google cloud platform permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Free-tier in Google Cloud Platform</h2>\n<p>Basic server configuration starts with creating a <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/compute\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Compute Engine</a> instance. When creating it, we must remember about the appropriate region — although here the choice is more about continents. The instance that interests us is F1-micro, which will be enough for us to provide this and several other services.\nThe next step will be to connect to the server via SSH and install OpenVPN. Unfortunately, for first-time users, installing OpenVPN can be a bit complicated. Large descriptions of functions in the documentation, no direct support for some distributions, configuration of files without full understanding. Unfortunately, this is not the simplest solution. Therefore, for users who do not want to play with the configuration of the server to support the entire company, but only for private purposes, very nice repositories have been created to auto-install this service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Simplest instalation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">If someone want more controll over configs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After installation, all you need to remember is editing firewall rules to allow incoming traffic from another port. For GCP, we can find it at <a href=\"https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this link</a>. It is suggested to add a new rule, assign the VPN ports, add a tag to the Compute Engine instance and reset the system to accept all changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#summary\" aria-label=\"summary permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>If someone can install servers quickly or has their VPS abroad, this is a perfect opportunity to have a VPN for streaming services. Thanks to this, we will be able to use the advantages of service providers such as NordVPN or ExpressVPN without the need to buy a subscription or free providers with trial access and shady data usage. In addition, the data that passes through the server is ours, so there is less risk of it being viewed by an unknown person from an unknown proxy server.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/your-own-vpn-service-in-usa","tagSlugs":["/tag/technology/","/tag/ops-dev-ops/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-11-01T21:37:05.000Z","description":"Regional locks aren't fun.
